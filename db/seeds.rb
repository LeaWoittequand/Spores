  description: "That's the beginning of 'Spores expansion'. Many of our users were requesting us that they wanted more Spores Homes but also ready to contribute financially for them.In the other hand Spores did not demonstrate yet that they were financially sustainable as they wanted to encourage social entrepreneurs.Two questions came to our mind : Why 20 peoples can't own an Home ? Why can't we become producers for something linked to local culture ? We learnt laws and build an SCI which allowed Multiple Ownership of French Property. We stimulate our neurons and ends with France and Wine Makers.",
  environment: "The home is surrounded by wine grasps, you are at the epicenter of the wine culture and french gastronomy. There is also calm roads for road cycling and parcs to hike.
